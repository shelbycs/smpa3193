Shelby SabatNew Yorker Cartoons ExerciseAssignment:Using Pivot Tables (plus some additional calculations), answer the following questions:1) What percentage of the characters were non-white? 96 out of 1810, which is 0.05%.2) What percentage of the characters were women? 533 out of 1810, which is 0.29%.3) Which cartoonist had the highest percentage of non-white characters? Haefeli4) What percentage of the characters were both non-white and female? 25 out of 1810, which is 0.01%.5) Write a paragraph that summarizes your key findings. (you can use the results from questions above and/or do your own additional analysis)	Evidently, there are not a lot of non-white characters in the New Yorker’s cartoons. This surprises me because cartoons are supposed to illustrate the news in a different way. Since there have been many Black Lives Matter protests and race has recently become a controversial issue in this country, it is surprising that cartoonists are not involving themselves in this political issue.
